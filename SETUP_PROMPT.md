# Setup Prompt for AI Assistants

Copy the code block below and paste it into ChatGPT, Claude, or any other AI assistant to get beginner-friendly setup guidance:

```
I want to set up a health/wellness article auto-generation project on my computer. 
The project uses Node.js, Playwright, and TypeScript to:
1. Scrape trending health topics from Newrank website
2. Generate articles using Bohrium AI
3. Save articles and references to local folders

Here's what I need to do:

**Step 1: Install Node.js**
- My operating system is: [Windows / Mac / Linux]
- I've never used Node.js before, so I need detailed beginner instructions

**Step 2: Get the project files**
- I have the project files located at: [provide your actual path here]
- Help me understand the folder structure

**Step 3: Install dependencies**
- Guide me through running npm install
- Explain what Playwright does and why we need it

**Step 4: Run the project**
- First, I want to get trending topics by running npm run scrape
- Then I want to generate an article by running npm run generate
- Explain what happens in each step
- What should I expect to see?
- What are common errors and how to fix them?

**Step 5: Find and view my generated articles**
- Where will my articles be saved?
- How do I open and read them?
- Can I edit them?

**Step 6: Troubleshooting**
- What if I need to log in to Bohrium the first time?
- How do I fix common errors?
- How do I clear my login and start fresh?

Please provide:
- Clear, step-by-step instructions
- Terminal commands (with examples for Windows, Mac, and Linux)
- Screenshots or descriptions of what should happen
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them
- Definitions of technical terms

My goal is to run this every day to generate new wellness articles. Make sure the instructions are easy enough that I can do this daily without getting confused.
